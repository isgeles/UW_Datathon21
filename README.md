# UW_Datathon21
Dataverse Datathon '21 organised by UWaterloo Data Science Club

# Motivation

Given data on patient features such as age, sex, blood pressure, body mass index, physical health, and many others, we seek to predict the presence of diabetes.

# Data

The dataset is a cleaned version of the BFRSS 2015 dataset containing 70692 rows and 22 columns.

# Technologies 

pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and tensorflow were used for data analysis.

# Modelling

To make predictions, support vector machines, decision tree, random forest, and neural networks were used for modelling.
